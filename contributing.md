# Contributing
* Please use Unity 2020.1.3f1 if you are going to contribute
* Be careful about pushing/pulling while someone else is due to merge conflicts. 
* Pull, commit and then push
* Push often to prevent large merge conflicts
* In Unity's editor settings, set the version control mode to be "visible meta files" and the Asset Seralization mode to "force text"
* Here is a good video on how to use github for Unity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH7qDUYHGK8
